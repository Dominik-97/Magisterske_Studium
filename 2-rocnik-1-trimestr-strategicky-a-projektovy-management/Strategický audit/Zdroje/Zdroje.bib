	shorttitle = {Environmental sustainability of facilities management},
	abstract = {Purpose
Rapid changes in the environment escalate the requirement of environmental sustainability assessment within built environment. The purpose of this paper is to model the environmental sustainability of facilities management ({FM}) functions in apparel industry in Sri Lanka.

Design/methodology/approach
A comprehensive literature review was carried out in order to identify the importance of sustainability assessment for {FM}, sustainable {FM} functions and their environmental sustainability indicators. Subsequently, a questionnaire survey was carried out to determine a relative weight of the sustainable {FM} functions and environmental sustainability indicators through the analytical hierarchy process analysis.

Findings
Energy management was identified as the most significant {FM} function in terms of environmental sustainability in apparel industry with a relative performance of 49.12 per cent. Subsequently, the functions of water management (29.39 per cent), maintenance management (11.98 per cent) and waste management (9.64 per cent) obtained the second, third and fourth ranks while asset management (7.85 per cent) was the function which had the least performance score. Relative weights for the environmental sustainability indicators were also determined.

Research limitations/implications
In respect of the apparel industry, the developed model can be utilised for assessing the environmental sustainability of {FM} in broader term.

Originality/value
No proper mechanism was found to assess the sustainability of {FM} in apparel sector since very fewer research studies were focussed on achieving environmental sustainability in different industries. Hence, the assessment of environmental sustainability of {FM} in apparel industry is an emerging necessity in the present day, which was addressed in this research.},

	doi = {10.1002/smj.3048},
	shorttitle = {Centers of Gravity},
	abstract = {Research Summary
We study the processes of firm growth in the evolution of the Japanese cotton spinning industry during 1883‐1914 by integrating strategy and historical approaches and utilizing rich quantitative firm‐level data and detailed business histories. The resultant conceptual model highlights growth outcomes of path dependencies as firms evolve across periods of single vs. shared leadership, establish stability in shared leadership, or experience repeated discord‐induced {TMT} leader departures. While most firms do not experience smooth transitions to stable shared {TMT} leadership, a focus on value creation, in conjunction with talent recruitment and promotion, enabled some firms to achieve stable shared leadership in spite of discord‐induced departures, engage in long term expansion, and emerge as “centers of gravity” for output and talent in the industry.

Managerial Summary
We demonstrate stable shared leadership is at root of firms who emerge as centers of gravity in an industry and account for the lion’s share of output. Stable shared leadership enables growth strategies such as talent recruitment, product diversification, downstream integration, and acquisitions. Stable shared leadership, however, is extremely difficult to maintain. Most firms experience discord‐induced departures in top management teams due to politics and power struggles. Firms that deviate from this norm to become industry leaders achieve stable shared leadership by adhering to fundamental principles related to long‐term value creation as opposed to short‐term gain, adoption of merit‐based promotion systems in defiance of stereotypes, sharing of power within {TMT} leadership to enable efficient division of labor, and honorable resolution of conflicts and ethical breaches.},
